UFO-Finder

Aliens are real! This is a collection of data from eye-witness reports to prove aliens are amoungt us. 
Using the webpage that has been built we will see where and when these sightings have occcured.

Technology:

•	JavaScript

•	HTML

•	CSS

•	D3.js

Directions:

Create a basic HTML web page or use the index.html file provided (we recommend building your own custom page!).


Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.



Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

Useability:

On this webpage you are able to use the search bar to filter threw the data by Date in order to find how many sighting were seen in one day in which city, state or country it occured.
You will also be able to see how long the sighting was occured.
Each sighting will give a discription of what was seen as well as the shape that was seen.
Some of the shapes are unfortunatly unknown while others seem to be the same. 
A few examples consist of circles, triangles, formations, spheres, disk
while other ones were considered shapes are lights and fireballs.
